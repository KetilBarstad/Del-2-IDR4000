  abstract = {Introduction~           The myonuclear domain theory postulates that myonuclei are added to muscle fibers when increases in fiber cross-sectional area (i.e., hypertrophy) are {$\geq$}26\%. However, recent studies have reported increased myonuclear content with lower levels (e.g., 12\%) of muscle fiber hypertrophy.           Purpose~           This study aimed to determine whether a muscle fiber hypertrophy ``threshold'' is required to drive the addition of new myonuclei to existing muscle fibers.           Methods~           Studies of resistance training endurance training with or without nutrient (i.e., protein) supplementation and steroid administration with measures of muscle fiber hypertrophy and myonuclei number as primary or secondary outcomes were considered. Twenty-seven studies incorporating 62 treatment groups and 903 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses.           Results~           Muscle fiber hypertrophy of {$\leq$}10\% induces increases in myonuclear content, although a significantly higher number of myonuclei are observed when muscle hypertrophy is \textasciitilde 22\%. Additional analyses showed that age, sex, and muscle fiber type do not influence muscle fiber hypertrophy or myonuclei addition.           Conclusions~           Although a more consistent myonuclei addition occurs when muscle fiber hypertrophy is {$>$}22\%, our results challenge the concept of a muscle hypertrophy threshold as significant myonuclei addition occurs with lower muscle hypertrophy (i.e., {$<$}10\%).},

  abstract = {The objective of this work was to investigate myonuclear permanence and transcriptional regulation as mechanisms for cellular muscle memory after strength training in humans. Twelve untrained men and women performed 10 weeks of unilateral elbow-flexor strength training followed by 16 weeks of de-training. Thereafter, 10 weeks' re-training was conducted with both arms: the previously trained arm and the contralateral untrained control arm. Muscle biopsies were taken from the trained arm before and after both training periods and from the control arm before and after re-training. Muscle biopsies were analysed for fibre cross-sectional area (fCSA), myonuclei and global transcriptomics (RNA sequencing). During the first training period, myonuclei increased in type 1 (13 \textpm{} 17\%) and type 2 (33 \textpm{} 23\%) fibres together with a 30 \textpm{} 43\% non-significant increase in mixed fibre fCSA (P = 0.069). Following de-training, fCSA decreased in both fibre types, whereas myonuclei were maintained, resulting in 33\% higher myonuclear number in previously trained vs. control muscle in type 2 fibres. Furthermore, in the previously trained muscle, three differentially expressed genes (DEGs; EGR1, MYL5 and COL1A1) were observed. Following re-training, the previously trained muscle showed larger type 2 fCSA compared to the control (P = 0.035). However, delta change in type 2 fCSA was not different between muscles. Gene expression was more dramatically changed in the control arm (1338 DEGs) than in the previously trained arm (822 DEGs). The sustained higher number of myonuclei in the previously trained muscle confirms myonuclear accretion and permanence in humans. Nevertheless, because of the unclear effect on the subsequent hypertrophy with re-training, the physiological benefit remains to be determined. Key points Muscle memory is a cellular mechanism that describes the capacity of skeletal muscle fibres to respond differently to training stimuli if the stimuli have been previously encountered. This study overcomes past methodological limitations related to the choice of muscles and analytical procedures. We show that myonuclear number is increased after strength training and maintained during de-training. Increased myonuclear number and differentially expressed genes related to muscle performance and development in the previously trained muscle did not translate into a clearly superior responses during re-training. Because of the unclear effect on the subsequent hypertrophy and muscle strength gain with re-training, the physiological benefit remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {We examined hypertrophic outcomes of weekly graded whey protein dosing (GWP) versus whey protein (WP) or maltodextrin (MALTO) dosed once daily during 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age=5\textpm 3 yrs; mean\textpm SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein frequency was 3 d/wk and each session involved 2 upper- and 2 lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from 10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants were assigned to WP (25g/d; n=10), MALTO (30g/d; n=10), or GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n=11), and supplementation occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps brachii ultrasounds for muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3 (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p{$<$}0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p{$<$}0.05). However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p{$<$}0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area (\textasciitilde +300 {$\mu$}m2). When examining the effects of training on LBM increases ({$\Delta$}LBM) in all participants combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p{$<$}0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85 kg, p{$<$}0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting {$\Delta$}LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was observed at PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p{$<$}0.001) but not MID to POST (+0.25 kg; p=0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP supplementation may be a viable strategy to optimize body composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program, ECW-corrected {$\Delta$}LBM gains were largely dampened, but still positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded \textasciitilde 20 sets/exercise/wk.},

  abstract = {Limited evidence exists regarding differentially expressed biomarkers between previously-trained low versus high hypertrophic responders in response to resistance training. Herein, 30 college-aged males (training age 5\textpm 3 years; mean\textpm SD) partook in 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Body composition, right leg vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies, and blood were obtained prior to training (PRE) and at the 3-week (W3) and 6-week time points (W6). The 10 lowest (LOW) and 10 highest (HIGH) hypertrophic responders were clustered based upon a composite hypertrophy score of PRE-to-W6 changes in right leg VL mean muscle fiber cross sectional area (fCSA), VL thickness assessed via ultrasound, upper right leg lean soft tissue mass assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and mid-thigh circumference. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare biomarker differences between the LOW and HIGH clusters over time, and stepwise linear regression was performed to elucidate biomarkers that explained significant variation in the composite hypertrophy score from PRE to W3, W3 to W6, and PRE to W6 in all 30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a composite hypertrophy change of +10.7\textpm 3.2\% and -2.1\textpm 1.6\%, respectively (pW3{$>$}PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE{$>$}W3\&W6), pan-mTOR (PRE{$>$}W3W3W3W3), muscle ubiquitin-labelled proteins (PRE{$>$}W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6{$>$}W3\&PRE), 45s rRNA (PRE{$>$}W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE{$>$}W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase). Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R2=0.152, {$\beta$}=0.390, p=0.033) and PRE type II fCSA (R2=0.207, {$\beta$}=-0.455, p=0.019) best predicted the PRE-to-W6 change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size is limited, these data suggest: a) HIGH responders may exhibit more growth potential given that they possessed lower PRE type II fCSA values, and b) possessing a greater type II fiber percentage as a trained individual may be advantageous for hypertrophy in response to resistance training.},

  abstract = {A present debate in muscle biology is whether myonuclear addition is required during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We utilized K-means cluster analysis to classify 66 humans after 16 wk of knee extensor resistance training as extreme (Xtr, n = 17), modest (Mod, n = 32), or nonresponders (Non, n = 17) based on myofiber hypertrophy, which averaged 58, 28, and 0\%, respectively (Bamman MM, Petrella JK, Kim JS, Mayhew DL, Cross JM. J Appl Physiol 102: 2232--2239, 2007). We hypothesized that robust hypertrophy seen in Xtr was driven by superior satellite cell (SC) activation and myonuclear addition. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained at baseline and week 16. SCs were identified immunohistochemically by surface expression of neural cell adhesion molecule. At baseline, myofiber size did not differ among clusters; however, the SC population was greater in Xtr (P {$<$} 0.01) than both Mod and Non, suggesting superior basal myogenic potential. SC number increased robustly during training in Xtr only (117\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Myonuclear addition occurred in Mod (9\%; P {$<$} 0.05) and was most effectively accomplished in Xtr (26\%; P {$<$} 0.001). After training, Xtr had more myonuclei per fiber than Non (23\%; P {$<$} 0.05) and tended to have more than Mod (19\%; P = 0.056). Both Xtr and Mod expanded the myonuclear domain to meet (Mod) or exceed (Xtr) 2,000 {$\mu$}m2 per nucleus, possibly driving demand for myonuclear addition to support myofiber expansion. These findings strongly suggest myonuclear addition via SC recruitment may be required to achieve substantial myofiber hypertrophy in humans. Individuals with a greater basal presence of SCs demonstrated, with training, a remarkable ability to expand the SC pool, incorporate new nuclei, and achieve robust growth.},

  abstract = {Aim Muscle fibre hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in myonuclear number, an increase in myonuclear domain size or both. It has been suggested that increases in myonuclear domain size precede myonuclear accretion and subsequent muscle fibre hypertrophy during prolonged exercise training. In this study, we assessed the changes in muscle fibre size, myonuclear and satellite cell content throughout 12 weeks of resistance-type exercise training in young men. Methods Twenty-two young men (23 \textpm{} 1 year) were assigned to a progressive, 12-weeks resistance-type exercise training programme (3 sessions per week). Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were taken before and after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of exercise training. Muscle fibre size, myonuclear content, myonuclear domain size and satellite cell content were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results Type I and type II muscle fibre size increased gradually throughout the 12 weeks of training (type I: 18 \textpm{} 5\%, type II: 41 \textpm{} 6\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Myonuclear content increased significantly over time in both the type I (P {$<$} 0.01) and type II (P {$<$} 0.001) muscle fibres. No changes in type I and type II myonuclear domain size were observed at any time point throughout the intervention. Satellite cell content increased significantly over time in both type I and type II muscle fibres (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion Increases in myonuclear domain size do not appear to drive myonuclear accretion and muscle fibre hypertrophy during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in vivo in humans.},
