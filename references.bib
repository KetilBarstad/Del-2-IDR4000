  abstract = {Resistance training (RT) may improve metabolic health; however, the extent of its effectiveness is constantly evaluated to assess improvements in the group means, thus obscuring the heterogeneous individual effects. This study investigated inter-individual variation in response to RT as reflected in metabolic health indicators and how age, sex, nutrition, and pre-training phenotypes are associated with such variabilities. Methods Previously collected data of men and women (39-73 years, 135 trained, 73 non-trained controls) were pooled for analysis. Measurements were taken twice before training to estimate individual day-to-day variations and measurement errors (n = 208). The individual responsiveness to the 21-week RT in cardiometabolic health indicators (ie, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), cholesterol and triglycerides) was determined. Body composition was estimated by bioimpedance and dietary intake according to 4-day food diaries. Results Metabolic responses to RT seemed to be highly individual, and both beneficial and unfavorable changes were observed. Large inter-individual variations in training response were not explained by a subject's age, sex, body composition, or nutritional status, with the exception of improvements in HDL-C, which were associated with simultaneous decreases in body fat in older women. The incidence of metabolic syndrome diminished following RT. Conclusion This study showed that RT could improve some specific metabolic health indicators beyond normal day-to-day variations, especially in blood lipid profile. Further studies are needed to elucidate genetic and other mechanisms underlining the heterogeneity of RT responses. This knowledge may be useful in providing individually tailored exercise prescriptions as part of personalized preventative health care.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Introduction~           The myonuclear domain theory postulates that myonuclei are added to muscle fibers when increases in fiber cross-sectional area (i.e., hypertrophy) are {$\geq$}26\%. However, recent studies have reported increased myonuclear content with lower levels (e.g., 12\%) of muscle fiber hypertrophy.           Purpose~           This study aimed to determine whether a muscle fiber hypertrophy ``threshold'' is required to drive the addition of new myonuclei to existing muscle fibers.           Methods~           Studies of resistance training endurance training with or without nutrient (i.e., protein) supplementation and steroid administration with measures of muscle fiber hypertrophy and myonuclei number as primary or secondary outcomes were considered. Twenty-seven studies incorporating 62 treatment groups and 903 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses.           Results~           Muscle fiber hypertrophy of {$\leq$}10\% induces increases in myonuclear content, although a significantly higher number of myonuclei are observed when muscle hypertrophy is \textasciitilde 22\%. Additional analyses showed that age, sex, and muscle fiber type do not influence muscle fiber hypertrophy or myonuclei addition.           Conclusions~           Although a more consistent myonuclei addition occurs when muscle fiber hypertrophy is {$>$}22\%, our results challenge the concept of a muscle hypertrophy threshold as significant myonuclei addition occurs with lower muscle hypertrophy (i.e., {$<$}10\%).},

  abstract = {The objective of this work was to investigate myonuclear permanence and transcriptional regulation as mechanisms for cellular muscle memory after strength training in humans. Twelve untrained men and women performed 10 weeks of unilateral elbow-flexor strength training followed by 16 weeks of de-training. Thereafter, 10 weeks' re-training was conducted with both arms: the previously trained arm and the contralateral untrained control arm. Muscle biopsies were taken from the trained arm before and after both training periods and from the control arm before and after re-training. Muscle biopsies were analysed for fibre cross-sectional area (fCSA), myonuclei and global transcriptomics (RNA sequencing). During the first training period, myonuclei increased in type 1 (13 \textpm{} 17\%) and type 2 (33 \textpm{} 23\%) fibres together with a 30 \textpm{} 43\% non-significant increase in mixed fibre fCSA (P = 0.069). Following de-training, fCSA decreased in both fibre types, whereas myonuclei were maintained, resulting in 33\% higher myonuclear number in previously trained vs. control muscle in type 2 fibres. Furthermore, in the previously trained muscle, three differentially expressed genes (DEGs; EGR1, MYL5 and COL1A1) were observed. Following re-training, the previously trained muscle showed larger type 2 fCSA compared to the control (P = 0.035). However, delta change in type 2 fCSA was not different between muscles. Gene expression was more dramatically changed in the control arm (1338 DEGs) than in the previously trained arm (822 DEGs). The sustained higher number of myonuclei in the previously trained muscle confirms myonuclear accretion and permanence in humans. Nevertheless, because of the unclear effect on the subsequent hypertrophy with re-training, the physiological benefit remains to be determined. Key points Muscle memory is a cellular mechanism that describes the capacity of skeletal muscle fibres to respond differently to training stimuli if the stimuli have been previously encountered. This study overcomes past methodological limitations related to the choice of muscles and analytical procedures. We show that myonuclear number is increased after strength training and maintained during de-training. Increased myonuclear number and differentially expressed genes related to muscle performance and development in the previously trained muscle did not translate into a clearly superior responses during re-training. Because of the unclear effect on the subsequent hypertrophy and muscle strength gain with re-training, the physiological benefit remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Considerable variation exists between people in the muscle response to resistance training, but there are numerous ways muscle might adapt to overload that might explain this variable response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the range of responses concerning the training-induced change in maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) knee joint torque, quadriceps femoris (QF) maximum muscle force (F), physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and specific tension (F/PCSA). It was hypothesized that the variable change in QF specific tension between individuals would be less than that of MVC. Fifty-three untrained young men performed progressive leg-extension training three times a week for 9~weeks. F was determined from MVC torque, voluntary muscle activation level, antagonist muscle co-activation and patellar tendon moment arm. QF specific tension was established by dividing F by QF PCSA, which was calculated from the ratio of QF muscle volume to muscle fascicle length. MVC torque increased by 26~\textpm ~11\% (P~{$<~$}0.0001; range -1 to 52\%), while F increased by 22~\textpm ~11\% (P~{$<~$}0.0001; range -1 to 44\%). PCSA increased by 6~\textpm ~4\% (P~{$<~$}0.001; range -3 to 18\%) and specific tension increased by 17~\textpm ~11\% (P~{$<~$}0.0001; range -5 to 39\%). In conclusion, training-induced changes in F and PCSA varied substantially between individuals, giving rise to greater inter-individual variability in the specific tension response compared to that of MVC. Furthermore, it appears that the change in specific tension is responsible for the variable change in MVC.},

A randomized controlled cluster trial across 15 sites was employed. The outcomes were muscle cross sectional area (CSA) of the upper arm and thigh, and strength for chest press, leg press, and pulldown. Pre-testing preceded randomization to either the lpROM (n = 163) or fROM (n = 134) RT condition. Post-testing was completed following a 12-week intervention. Our primary estimand of interest was the condition by time interaction. The estimate for this effect for arm estimated muscle CSA was -0.032 and for thigh estimated muscle CSA was 0. The p-values for equivalence were p = 0.071 for the arm muscle, and p = 0.019 for the thigh muscle. Inference criteria with alpha were set at 0.01 and adjusted to 0.005 for multiple outcomes, as such, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis that the condition:time interaction effect was outside of the SESOI [-0.1, 0.1]. Exploratory analysis suggests that both the main effects of time, and any interaction effects for condition by time, are likely small. These findings support previous evidence comparing fROM and lpROM specifically and suggest that between condition effects are small and practically equivalent.},

  abstract = {We examined hypertrophic outcomes of weekly graded whey protein dosing (GWP) versus whey protein (WP) or maltodextrin (MALTO) dosed once daily during 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age=5\textpm 3 yrs; mean\textpm SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein frequency was 3 d/wk and each session involved 2 upper- and 2 lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from 10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants were assigned to WP (25g/d; n=10), MALTO (30g/d; n=10), or GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n=11), and supplementation occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps brachii ultrasounds for muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3 (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p{$<$}0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p{$<$}0.05). However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p{$<$}0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area (\textasciitilde +300 {$\mu$}m2). When examining the effects of training on LBM increases ({$\Delta$}LBM) in all participants combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p{$<$}0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85 kg, p{$<$}0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting {$\Delta$}LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was observed at PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p{$<$}0.001) but not MID to POST (+0.25 kg; p=0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP supplementation may be a viable strategy to optimize body composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program, ECW-corrected {$\Delta$}LBM gains were largely dampened, but still positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded \textasciitilde 20 sets/exercise/wk.},

Herein, 30 college-aged males (training age 5\textpm 3 years; mean\textpm SD) partook in 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Body composition, right leg vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies, and blood were obtained prior to training (PRE) and at the 3-week (W3) and 6-week time points (W6). The 10 lowest (LOW) and 10 highest (HIGH) hypertrophic responders were clustered based upon a composite hypertrophy score of PRE-to-W6 changes in right leg VL mean muscle fiber cross sectional area (fCSA), VL thickness assessed via ultrasound, upper right leg lean soft tissue mass assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and mid-thigh circumference. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare biomarker differences between the LOW and HIGH clusters over time, and stepwise linear regression was performed to elucidate biomarkers that explained significant variation in the composite hypertrophy score from PRE to W3, W3 to W6, and PRE to W6 in all 30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a composite hypertrophy change of +10.7\textpm 3.2\% and -2.1\textpm 1.6\%, respectively (pW3{$>$}PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE{$>$}W3\&W6), pan-mTOR (PRE{$>$}W3W3W3W3), muscle ubiquitin-labelled proteins (PRE{$>$}W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6{$>$}W3\&PRE), 45s rRNA (PRE{$>$}W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE{$>$}W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase). Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R2=0.152, {$\beta$}=0.390, p=0.033) and PRE type II fCSA (R2=0.207, {$\beta$}=-0.455, p=0.019) best predicted the PRE-to-W6 change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size is limited, these data suggest: a) HIGH responders may exhibit more growth potential given that they possessed lower PRE type II fCSA values, and b) possessing a greater type II fiber percentage as a trained individual may be advantageous for hypertrophy in response to resistance training.},

Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean\textpm SD) = +0.11\textpm 0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40\textpm 0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69\textpm 0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST{$>$}PRE, p{$<$}0.05) but no cluster\texttimes time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was \textasciitilde 12\% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being \textasciitilde 12\% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r2 = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351\textpm 70 ng/mg to 380\textpm 62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369\textpm 115 to 429\textpm 92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356\textpm 77 to 470\textpm 134, p{$<$}0.001; POST HI{$>$}POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r2 = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1{$\beta$} mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p{$<$}0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r2 = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only \textasciitilde 8--11\% of the variance in hypertrophy.},

Specifically, Type 2 muscle fibers reliably demonstrate a substantial capacity to hypertrophy in the absence of myonuclear accretion, challenging the notion of a tightly regulated myonuclear domain (i.e. area that each myonucleus transcriptionally governs). In fact, a ``myonuclear domain ceiling'', or upper limit of transcriptional output per nucleus to support hypertrophy, has yet to be identified. Independent from fusion, satellite cells play a role in damage repair and remodeling of the extracellular matrix during loading-induced muscle hypertrophy. We postulate that robust satellite cell activation and proliferation in response to mechanical loading is largely for these purposes. Future work will aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which Type 2 fibers can hypertrophy without additional myonuclei, the extent to which Type 1 fibers can grow without myonuclear accretion, and whether a true myonuclear domain ceiling exists.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle stem (satellite) cells supporting growth/regeneration are thought to be activated and incorporated into growing myofibers by both endocrine and locally expressed autocrine/paracrine growth factors, the latter being load sensitive. We recently found that myofiber hypertrophy with resistance training is superior in young men (YM) vs. young women and older adults (Kosek DJ, Kim JS, Petrella JK, Cross JM, and Bamman MM. J Appl Physiol 101: 531--544, 2006). We hypothesized that the advanced myofiber hypertrophy in YM is facilitated by myonuclear addition in response to a milieu promoting stem cell activation. Twenty-six young (27.0 \textpm{} 1 yr, 50\% women) and 26 older (63.7 \textpm{} 1 yr, 50\% women) adults completed 16 wk of knee extensor resistance training. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained at baseline, 24 h after one bout, and after 16 wk. Muscle stem cells were identified immunohistochemically with anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM+). Muscle transcript levels of IGF-I and mechanogrowth factor (MGF) were determined by RT-PCR. Serum IGF-I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, IGFBP-1, total and free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and androstenedione were assessed by radioimmunoassay. Myofiber hypertrophy was twofold greater in YM vs. others, and only YM increased NCAM+ cells per 100 myofibers (49\%) and myonuclei per fiber (19\%) (P {$<$} 0.05). IGF-IEa mRNA was higher in young and increased acutely (29\%) with summation by 16 wk (96\%) (P {$<$} 0.05). MGF mRNA increased only in young after one bout (81\%) and by 16 wk (85\%) (P {$<$} 0.001). Circulating IGF-I was twofold higher in young, whereas IGFBP-1 was lowest in YM (P {$<$} 0.05). Among men, free testosterone was 59\% higher in YM (P {$<$} 0.01). Myonuclear addition was most effectively accomplished in YM, which likely drove the superior growth.},

  abstract = {A present debate in muscle biology is whether myonuclear addition is required during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We utilized K-means cluster analysis to classify 66 humans after 16 wk of knee extensor resistance training as extreme (Xtr, n = 17), modest (Mod, n = 32), or nonresponders (Non, n = 17) based on myofiber hypertrophy, which averaged 58, 28, and 0\%, respectively (Bamman MM, Petrella JK, Kim JS, Mayhew DL, Cross JM. J Appl Physiol 102: 2232--2239, 2007). We hypothesized that robust hypertrophy seen in Xtr was driven by superior satellite cell (SC) activation and myonuclear addition. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained at baseline and week 16. SCs were identified immunohistochemically by surface expression of neural cell adhesion molecule. At baseline, myofiber size did not differ among clusters; however, the SC population was greater in Xtr (P {$<$} 0.01) than both Mod and Non, suggesting superior basal myogenic potential. SC number increased robustly during training in Xtr only (117\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Myonuclear addition occurred in Mod (9\%; P {$<$} 0.05) and was most effectively accomplished in Xtr (26\%; P {$<$} 0.001). After training, Xtr had more myonuclei per fiber than Non (23\%; P {$<$} 0.05) and tended to have more than Mod (19\%; P = 0.056). Both Xtr and Mod expanded the myonuclear domain to meet (Mod) or exceed (Xtr) 2,000 {$\mu$}m2 per nucleus, possibly driving demand for myonuclear addition to support myofiber expansion. These findings strongly suggest myonuclear addition via SC recruitment may be required to achieve substantial myofiber hypertrophy in humans. Individuals with a greater basal presence of SCs demonstrated, with training, a remarkable ability to expand the SC pool, incorporate new nuclei, and achieve robust growth.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms underlying mechanical overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy have been extensively researched since the landmark report by Morpurgo (1897) of "work-induced hypertrophy" in dogs that were treadmill trained. Much of the preclinical rodent and human resistance training research to date supports that involved mechanisms include enhanced mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, an expansion in translational capacity through ribosome biogenesis, increased satellite cell abundance and myonuclear accretion, and postexercise elevations in muscle protein synthesis rates. However, several lines of past and emerging evidence suggest that additional mechanisms that feed into or are independent of these processes are also involved. This review first provides a historical account of how mechanistic research into skeletal muscle hypertrophy has progressed. A comprehensive list of mechanisms associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy is then outlined, and areas of disagreement involving these mechanisms are presented. Finally, future research directions involving many of the discussed mechanisms are proposed.},

  abstract = {Numerous reports suggest there are low and high skeletal muscle hypertrophic responders following weeks to months of structured resistance exercise training (referred to as low and high responders herein). Specifically, divergent alterations in muscle fiber cross sectional area (fCSA), vastus lateralis thickness, and whole body lean tissue mass have been shown to occur in high versus low responders. Differential responses in ribosome biogenesis and subsequent protein synthetic rates during training seemingly explain some of this individual variation in humans, and mechanistic in vitro and rodent studies provide further evidence that ribosome biogenesis is critical for muscle hypertrophy. High responders may experience a greater increase in satellite cell proliferation during training versus low responders. This phenomenon could serve to maintain an adequate myonuclear domain size or assist in extracellular remodeling to support myofiber growth. High responders may also express a muscle microRNA profile during training that enhances insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression, although more studies are needed to better validate this mechanism. Higher intramuscular androgen receptor protein content has been reported in high versus low responders following training, and this mechanism may enhance the hypertrophic effects of testosterone during training. While high responders likely possess ``good genetics,'' such evidence has been confined to single gene candidates which typically share marginal variance with hypertrophic outcomes following training (e.g., different myostatin and IGF-1 alleles). Limited evidence also suggests pre-training muscle fiber type composition and self-reported dietary habits (e.g., calorie and protein intake) do not differ between high versus low responders. Only a handful of studies have examined muscle biomarkers that are differentially expressed between low versus high responders. Thus, other molecular and physiological variables which could potentially affect the skeletal muscle hypertrophic response to resistance exercise training are also discussed including rDNA copy number, extracellular matrix and connective tissue properties, the inflammatory response to training, and mitochondrial as well as vascular characteristics.},

  abstract = {Aim Muscle fibre hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in myonuclear number, an increase in myonuclear domain size or both. It has been suggested that increases in myonuclear domain size precede myonuclear accretion and subsequent muscle fibre hypertrophy during prolonged exercise training. In this study, we assessed the changes in muscle fibre size, myonuclear and satellite cell content throughout 12 weeks of resistance-type exercise training in young men. Methods Twenty-two young men (23 \textpm{} 1 year) were assigned to a progressive, 12-weeks resistance-type exercise training programme (3 sessions per week). Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were taken before and after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of exercise training. Muscle fibre size, myonuclear content, myonuclear domain size and satellite cell content were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results Type I and type II muscle fibre size increased gradually throughout the 12 weeks of training (type I: 18 \textpm{} 5\%, type II: 41 \textpm{} 6\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Myonuclear content increased significantly over time in both the type I (P {$<$} 0.01) and type II (P {$<$} 0.001) muscle fibres. No changes in type I and type II myonuclear domain size were observed at any time point throughout the intervention. Satellite cell content increased significantly over time in both type I and type II muscle fibres (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion Increases in myonuclear domain size do not appear to drive myonuclear accretion and muscle fibre hypertrophy during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in vivo in humans.},
